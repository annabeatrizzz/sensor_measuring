# Project
This project was developed during the course of Sensors and Signal Conditioning at Turku University of Applied Science! 

This project is focused on analyzing how a microcontroller work with an analog sensor to take measurements. Topics such as Type-A and Type-B Uncertainty, Rate Sampling and Jitter, and connecting the microcontroller with the sensor are topics developped.

## Components
- SparkFun ReadBoard (microcontroller)
- KY 013 Analog Temperature Sensor Module
- Wires
- Oscilloscope

  ## System Overview
The system was the sum of a microcontroller SparkFun ReadBoard and KY 013 Analog Temperature Sensor Module. Where we developed a code in ArduinoIDE to read the temperatures from the system, and used an application called Teraterm to save the readings for a later analysis. After enough material, we studied the Type-A and Type-B uncertainties of the system where we could notice the errors in measurement, and the effects of jitter to the experiment.
